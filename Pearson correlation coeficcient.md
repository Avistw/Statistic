# What is Pearson correlation coefficent? 

#### When a bunch of data has certain ways as below can use Pearson correlation coefficient
1.1 To evaluate whether two variables are linear relationship. Coefficient correlation cannot explain the causation of variables.     

1.2 When you want to measure the level of the correlation bettwen 2 variables

#### Characteristic of Person correlation coefficient
2.1. Using R value as degree of correlation bettwen 2 variables.  
Let's say normally R value range is from -1 to +1. When R value is -1 or +1 which means that two variable have strong correlation. 
If R value is 0 then it means there is no correlation bettwen two variable. If the value closer to 0, it shows weaker correlation bettwen to variables. 
For instance, 0.2 and -0.2 is weaker than 0.4 and -0.4.  

2.2 Negative value doesnt means coefficient.  
For instance, R value -0.2 doesnt mean that it is a negative coefficient. It only means the degree of the correlation is weak(compared to R =-0.4)  

2.3 R value demostrates the statistical dispersion, which means that how level of density of your dataset look like when you plot them.  
You plot all the dataset and add a trend line. If you see your data is not very closed to the linear line and rahter far away, it may represents that your R value is small.


#### Limitation of Pearson correlation coefficent
3.1 It can only demonstrate linear relationships bettwen variables.  

3.2 It can only be used in teh numerical statistical data instead of category data.   
(like measure the degree of correlation over a period of time of two variables)
