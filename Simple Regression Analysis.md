# What is Regression Analysis
Let's say you want to know the size of the room (X) will affect the price of rent (Y)?  
Or you want to know does the war happened (X) affect the price of the petrol (Y)?

You may want to know are those independent variables related to the dependent variable(the value or variable that you want to predict or to know), but how to know their causation?  

Regression is a way to evaluate the relationship within one or more independent variable(X) and dependent variable(Y). In order to do so, we create an linear equation to represent the relationship bettwen two variables.   

The concept of the regression:  
X happended --> Y happened   
**But cannot be Y happened ---> X happened**  
It must be X(independent variable) happened and it leads to Y(dependent variable) happened.  


# Prerequisite prior to using Regression Analysis 

### check your data 
Using **Scatter Disgram** to see how's the pattern bettwen the variables  
There are three patterns that you may observe based on your scatter plot.  
 1. Positive relationship ( can be a curve or a line)
 2. Negative relationship ( can be a curve or a line) 
 3. No relationship ( a horizontal) 

Note: only linear pattern or equation can use regression analysis.
